==Work in progress -- TODO list

NOTE that the current state of these snippets is quite uncomplete.
Feel free to fill in the gaps and send me your change suggestions.

I left the actual code here all of a sudden half a year ago. So chances are you will find gaps and holes. Here are some of the obvious I saw.

* There are references to 'BRS brugerrettigheds administration' -- should be changed to virk
* There are at least one 'To be done' reference in a snippet
